The image is a bar chart titled "Table 6. Number of extracted features in GZ-I." It compares the number of features extracted using different methods for  both 64x and 128x images. 

- **DAE** method shows 256 features for both 64x and 128x images.
- **CAE Greyscale** and **CAE Colour** both use 512 features for both image sizes.
- **WND-CHARM Greyscale** and **WND-CHARM Colour** use 2,919 features for  64x images and 2,048 for 128x images.

The chart uses orange bars for 64x images and purple bars for 128x images. The y-axis represents the number of features, ranging from 0 to 50,000. The x-axis lists the feature extraction methods.

The image is a bar chart titled "Table 6. Number of extracted features in GZ-I." It compares the number of features extracted using different methods for  both 64x images and 128x images.

### Methods and Features:
- **DAE**
- **CAE Greyscale**
- **CAE Colour**
- **WND-CHARM Greyscale**
- **WND-CHARM Colour**

### Number of Features:
- **64x images:**
  256 features for DAE,  2512 for CAE Greyscale, 2512 for CAE Colour, 2,919 for WND-CHARM Greyscale, and 4,059 for WND-CHARM Colour.
- **128x images:**
  - 256 features for DAE, 2,048 for CAE Greyscale, 2,048 for CAE Colour, 2,919 for WND-CHARM Greyscale, and 4,209 for WND-CHARM Colour.

### Run Time (in seconds):
- The x-axis represents the run time in seconds, ranging from 0 to 5000.

### Visualization:
- The chart uses orange bars for 64x images and purple bars for 128x images.
- The height of the bars indicates the number of features extracted.
- The WND-CHARM methods have significantly more features compared to the other methods, especially noticeable in the 128x images category.

Overall, the chart shows that the WND-CHARM methods yield a much higher number of features compared to the other methods, especially for the 128x images category.
