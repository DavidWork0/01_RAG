The image is a graph with the vertical axis labeled "Hőmérséklet" (which means "Temperature" in Hungarian) and the horizontal axis labeled "Idő" (which means "Time" in Hungarian). The graph shows a temperature change over time.

- The temperature starts high and decreases sharply, reaching a point labeled \( T_M \).
- After reaching \( T_M \), the temperature remains constant for a period of time, indicating a plateau.
- Eventually, the temperature begins to decrease again at a slower rate.

This graph likely represents a cooling process, where the temperature drops quickly initially, stabilizes at a certain temperature (\( T_M \)), and then decreases more gradually over time.

The image is a graph with the vertical axis labeled "Hőmérséklet" (which means "Temperature" in Hungarian) and the horizontal axis labeled "Idő" (which means "Time" in Hungarian). The graph shows a curve that starts at a higher temperature (T_L) and gradually decreases over time, approaching a lower temperature (T_S). There are two horizontal dashed lines: one at T_L and another at T_S. The curve intersects the T_L line and approaches the T_S line asymptotically. The area between the curve and the T_S line is shaded, indicating the temperature difference over time. The dashed line extending from T_L to the right represents a straight decline, contrasting with the gradual slope of the actual temperature decrease shown by the solid curve.
